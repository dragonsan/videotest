<b>I have to think about what I should do <i>to</i> graduate.</b>

17:28.440 --> 17:31.800
<b>I hope we can see each other even after we graduate.</b>

17:32.360 --> 17:35.700
<b>I want us to stay like this forever.</b>

17:35.700 --> 17:38.240
<b>You really <i>are</i> asleep now, aren't you?</b>

17:38.240 --> 17:40.410
<b>Maybe.</b>

17:40.410 --> 17:42.910
<b>What do you think?</b>

17:42.910 --> 17:44.870
<b>Don't ask me.</b>

17:44.870 --> 17:46.710
<b>Just go home already.</b>

17:46.710 --> 17:48.670
<b>Say, Touma.</b>

17:48.670 --> 17:51.960
<b>Didn't you enjoy the time we spent together?</b>

17:51.960 --> 17:53.590
<b>You, Setsuna, and me.</b>

17:53.590 --> 17:56.930
<b>Weren't you glad the three of us got together?</b>

17:56.930 --> 18:00.510
<b>Every day, I was really happy and had lots of fun.</b>

18:00.510 --> 18:03.140
<b>I mean, well...</b>

18:03.140 --> 18:06.350
<b>There was this impossibly distant flower I'd always wanted to get to know,</b>

18:06.350 --> 18:09.860
<b>yet she came to me of her own accord.</b>

18:09.860 --> 18:14.320
<b>Then there was the girl I've admired and wanted to be friends with for so long.</b>

18:14.320 --> 18:16.240
<b>She and I understand each other at last.</b>

18:16.240 --> 18:19.510
<b>We've become real friends.</b>

18:22.370 --> 18:26.290
<b>So she's a flower and I'm just a girl?</b>

18:26.290 --> 18:27.850
<b>Don't like it?</b>

18:28.920 --> 18:30.810
<b>How could I not?</b>

18:31.170 --> 18:33.840
<b>How could I not have enjoyed myself?</b>

18:33.840 --> 18:36.130
<b>How could I not have been happy?</b>

18:36.130 --> 18:39.680
<b>Then let me see it in your face.</b>

18:39.680 --> 18:42.620
<b>It's hard to tell with that poker face of yours.</b>

18:44.510 --> 18:45.910
<b>Touma?</b>

18:51.060 --> 18:53.020
<b>What's wrong, Touma?</b>

18:53.020 --> 18:55.630
<b>Why are you trembling?</b>

18:57.940 --> 18:59.860
<b>I'm cold.</b>

18:59.860 --> 19:03.390
<b>Oh, yeah. It's almost winter, I guess.</b>

19:04.410 --> 19:05.600
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:06.830 --> 19:09.560
<b>White Album season's coming.</b>

19:26.140 --> 19:28.660
<b>H... Huh?</b>

19:29.060 --> 19:30.370
<b>Touma?</b>

19:32.730 --> 19:34.560
<b>She went home, huh?</b>

19:34.560 --> 19:36.210
<b>Wakey wakey.</b>

19:37.900 --> 19:39.260
<b>Huh?</b>

19:41.450 --> 19:42.950
<b>Wakey wakey!</b>

19:42.950 --> 19:44.200
<b>Uh...</b>

19:44.200 --> 19:46.200
<b>Um, what about your class event?</b>

19:46.200 --> 19:47.830
<b>That ended a long time ago.</b>

19:47.830 --> 19:49.120
<b>It's almost six, you know.</b>

19:49.120 --> 19:51.330
<b>It's that late already?</b>

19:51.330 --> 19:52.670
<b>I slept for a while, huh?</b>

19:52.670 --> 19:53.710
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:53.710 --> 19:56.460
<b>It's already been more than
half an hour since I got here.</b>

19:56.460 --> 19:58.090
<b>You should've woken me up!</b>

19:58.090 --> 19:59.340
<b>Why would I?</b>

19:59.340 --> 20:03.220
<b>If I had, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy looking at your sleeping face.</b>

20:03.220 --> 20:04.570
<b>Whaâ€”</b>

20:09.060 --> 20:10.730
<b>Did you put this on me?</b>

20:10.730 --> 20:13.900
<b>Mom brought it for me.</b>

20:13.900 --> 20:16.230
<b>Change of clothes since I didn't go home last night.</b>

20:16.230 --> 20:17.570
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

20:17.570 --> 20:19.990
<b>It's the guy's job to do this kinda stuff.</b>

20:19.990 --> 20:21.360
<b>Don't be.</b>

20:21.360 --> 20:25.620
<b>You've more than done your job as a guy.</b>

20:25.620 --> 20:27.830
<b>You gave me the courage</b>

20:27.830 --> 20:32.000
<b>to stand on that high stage,
face all of those people,</b>

20:32.000 --> 20:35.500
<b>and still have fun singing.</b>

20:35.500 --> 20:38.750
<b>Nah, you had that courage all along.</b>

20:38.750 --> 20:40.490
<b>I didn't do a thing.</b>

20:42.550 --> 20:44.090
<b>It was <i>so</i> much fun, right?</b>

20:44.090 --> 20:45.760
<b>Way too fun!</b>

20:45.760 --> 20:47.890
<b>Concerts get you really nervous,</b>

20:47.890 --> 20:51.480
<b>but now that I've experienced what it's like, I don't think I can stop!</b>

20:51.480 --> 20:54.350
<b>Yeah, I still remember it clearly.</b>

20:54.350 --> 20:59.150
<b>I stood there in that spotlight
and sang my heart out, didn't I?</b>

20:59.150 --> 21:01.690
<b>The cheering is still ringing in my ears.</b>

21:01.690 --> 21:04.820
<b>When I close my eyes, it feels like
I'm still living that dream.</b>

21:04.820 --> 21:09.330
<b>Well, in that case, why don't the
three of us perform together again?</b>

21:09.330 --> 21:10.830
<b>I'm nothing special,</b>

21:10.830 --> 21:14.660
<b>but together we should be able to perform in much larger events.</b>

21:14.660 --> 21:16.290
<b>Hey, Haruki-kun.</b>

21:16.290 --> 21:17.290
<b>Huh?</b>

21:17.290 --> 21:20.400
<b>Stay with me forever, okay?</b>

21:21.050 --> 21:23.160
<b>If you're okay with it, sure.</b>

21:25.470 --> 21:27.720
<b>You already got into Houjou University, right?</b>

21:27.720 --> 21:29.640
<b>I hope we can be in the same school.{faculty/department/etc.}</b>

21:29.640 --> 21:31.140
<b>Which one are you going for?</b>

21:31.140 --> 21:35.600
<b>I was thinking politics and economics,
but you don't <i>have</i> to follow me there.</b>

21:35.600 --> 21:37.770
<b>Think about what you want to study first.</b>

21:37.770 --> 21:38.730
<b>But, like,</b>

21:38.730 --> 21:41.360
<b>it'll really affect how much time
we can spend together!</b>

21:41.360 --> 21:42.940
<b>What's gotten into you?</b>

21:42.940 --> 21:45.530
<b>Why are you so anxious?</b>

21:45.530 --> 21:48.160
<b>I can't afford to wait.</b>

21:48.160 --> 21:49.680
<b>Why's that?</b>

21:50.450 --> 21:52.370
<b>You promised me, right?</b>

21:52.370 --> 21:54.910
<b>Even after we graduate and
start moving through university,</b>

21:54.910 --> 21:57.040
<b>even if we end up in different programs,</b>

21:57.040 --> 21:59.500
<b>and then... and then... uh...</b>

21:59.500 --> 22:00.960
<b>Calm down.</b>

22:00.960 --> 22:02.300
<b>Let me turn the lights onâ€”</b>

22:02.300 --> 22:03.440
<b>Don't!</b>

22:05.420 --> 22:07.090
<b>Don't do it.</b>

22:07.090 --> 22:10.390
<b>It'd wake me from my dream.</b>

22:10.390 --> 22:14.470
<b>I want to keep dreaming today.</b>

22:14.470 --> 22:18.770
<b>I was able to truly enjoy singing the song I love,</b>

22:18.770 --> 22:22.070
<b>and I was praised by the person I love.</b>

22:22.070 --> 22:26.320
<b>So I let it get to my head
and begged for a reward.</b>

22:26.320 --> 22:33.910
<b>When I did, he smiled wryly and
gently embraced pampered little me.</b>

22:33.910 --> 22:36.120
<b>Setsuna?</b>

22:36.120 --> 22:40.560
<b>This is kinda different from what I'd imagined, though.</b>

22:41.420 --> 22:45.340
<b>I can't believe I'm taking the lead myself.</b>

22:45.340 --> 22:48.930
<b>This wasn't part of my plans.</b>

22:48.930 --> 22:51.590
<b>I was supposed to be on the receiving end...</b>

22:51.590 --> 22:57.770
<b>and be a little surprised, but then let you
because it's what I'd been waiting for.</b>

22:57.770 --> 23:02.710
<b>That's the kind of naive little dream I had.</b>

23:04.820 --> 23:07.780
<b>Hey, Haruki-kun.</b>

23:07.780 --> 23:11.220
<b>You don't have to, okay?</b>

23:17.660 --> 23:20.480
<b>White Album season's coming.</b>

23:34.430 --> 23:38.980
<b>The Best and Last Day</b>

23:34.430 --> 23:38.980
<b>The Best and Last Day</b>

<b>The Best and Last Day</b>
